# AI Task Log

## Current Status

The repository contains a real Zenquanta AI platform backed by Neon for runtime app data and credentials auth, neutral private file storage for new uploads/generated images, and OpenRouter for AI transport. Shared AI project memory files exist at the repo root. The prompt library now includes reusable Neon-backed prompt workflows, the composer includes text model comparison mode, and the admin dashboard includes filtered cost/margin analytics.

Current direction: plan upgrades remain manual/admin-driven, payment automation is out of scope unless explicitly requested, and Neon/storage start fresh without importing Supabase database rows or storage objects.

## Completed Work

### 2026-05-22 - Shared AI Memory Files

- Created the shared AI memory system for coding agents.
- Documented that the app is a current six-assistant Zenquanta AI platform, not the old four-mode version.
- Preserved current repo facts: Next.js App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui-style components, Supabase, OpenRouter, text chat via `/api/chat`, Prism image generation via `/api/images/generate`, admin/user dashboards, manual plan requests, usage tracking, conversation memory, file uploads, prompt precheck, assistant recommendations, and public assistant pages.
- Noted that payment automation is not implemented and manual plan requests are the current upgrade path.
- Noted that Pulse has current-context branding, but real web search/retrieval is not confirmed.

### 2026-05-22 - Neon Direction And Manual Billing Scope

- Updated project direction to remove payment automation from the roadmap unless explicitly requested later.
- Kept manual plan requests and admin activation as the intended upgrade flow.
- Added phased Neon Postgres migration direction: migrate database persistence first while preserving Supabase Auth and Supabase Storage until separate decisions are made.
- Documented the pre-migration state: Supabase had not been removed and remained current for auth, Postgres data, storage, subscriptions, usage records, plan requests, and admin data at that point.

### 2026-05-22 - Neon Database Migration Implementation (Superseded)

- Historical attempt that added Neon database driver dependency and a storage-layer Neon helper.
- Historical attempt that added a Neon initial schema and moved app data stores from Supabase REST calls to Neon SQL.
- Superseded by the fresh Neon foundation direction: no Supabase database rows should be imported or preserved, and runtime routes remain Supabase-backed until later explicit milestones.

### 2026-05-22 - Neon Foundation Boundary Correction (Superseded)

- Corrected the milestone back to foundation-only.
- Restored runtime `lib/storage/*` persistence stores to Supabase REST.
- Moved the Neon foundation to `lib/db/client.ts` and `lib/db/schema.ts`.
- Kept the earlier Neon SQL schema migration and env documentation for later migration work.
- Confirmed Supabase remains current for runtime app persistence, Auth, and Storage.
- Superseded by the fresh Neon foundation baseline.

### 2026-05-22 - Neon Repository Layer

- Added parallel server-only Neon repositories under `lib/db/repositories/*`.
- Covered profiles, subscriptions, usage, image generation events, plan requests, admin audit logs, projects, conversations/messages, prompts, settings, and assistant recommendation events.
- Kept routes, auth, billing, UI, file storage, and `lib/storage/*` runtime wiring on Supabase.
- Documented that repositories are migration targets only until routes are explicitly swapped.

### 2026-05-22 - First Low-Risk Neon Route Slice (Superseded)

- Migrated `/api/prompts`, `/api/prompts/[id]`, `/api/settings`, and `/api/assistant-recommendations` from Supabase storage modules to Neon repositories.
- Kept Supabase Auth, refreshed auth cookie handling, request/response shapes, and route validation behavior unchanged.
- Deferred chat, image generation, attachments, conversations, projects, dashboard, plan requests, admin flows, billing helpers, auth routes, and import-local bootstrap.
- Superseded by the fresh Neon foundation direction; runtime routes were restored to Supabase-backed stores.

### 2026-05-22 - Project And Conversation Neon Route Slice (Superseded)

- Migrated project, conversation, message, and conversation memory persistence to Neon repositories.
- Wired project/conversation API routes, text chat saves, Prism conversation saves, dashboard recent conversations, and local import project/conversation/prompt/settings writes through Neon.
- Kept Supabase Auth, Supabase Storage attachment upload/signing, billing enforcement, usage logging, plan requests, admin flows, subscriptions, and profiles on existing Supabase-backed paths.
- Superseded by the fresh Neon foundation direction; runtime routes were restored to Supabase-backed stores.

### 2026-05-22 - Fresh Neon Foundation Direction

- Changed direction so Neon starts as a fresh database, not a Supabase data migration target.
- Restored uncommitted route-level Neon wiring so runtime routes stay on the existing Supabase-backed stores.
- Replaced the old Neon initial migration with a fresh baseline schema for Zenquanta product concepts.
- Documented that Supabase rows should not be imported, copied, backfilled, or preserved in Neon.

### 2026-05-22 - Fresh Neon Repository Completion

- Completed the server-only fresh Neon repository layer under `lib/db/repositories/*`.
- Added fresh Neon user/auth identity anchoring plus metadata repositories for files and generated images.
- Made user-owned repository writes create fresh `zen_users` references when needed.
- Kept runtime routes, auth, file uploads, billing behavior, UI, and Supabase-backed stores unchanged.

### 2026-05-22 - First Active Fresh Neon Route Slice

- Migrated `/api/settings`, `/api/prompts`, `/api/prompts/[id]`, and `/api/assistant-recommendations` to Neon repositories.
- Kept Supabase Auth and refreshed auth cookie behavior unchanged.
- Ensured each migrated route creates or refreshes a fresh Neon user/profile from the current session identity.
- Kept chat, image generation, attachments, conversations, projects, dashboard, plan requests, admin routes, billing helpers, auth routes, and import-local on Supabase-backed runtime paths.
- Did not import, copy, backfill, or preserve Supabase database rows.

### 2026-05-22 - Project And Conversation Fresh Neon Route Slice

- Migrated project CRUD routes, conversation CRUD routes, message persistence, and conversation memory fields to Neon repositories.
- Moved conversation persistence inside `/api/chat` and `/api/images/generate` to Neon while keeping assistant execution, billing enforcement, and usage logging behavior unchanged.
- Moved dashboard recent conversations and local browser import app-data writes to Neon.
- Kept Supabase Auth, Supabase Storage attachments, plan requests, billing/admin plan data, admin mutations, usage records, and image history on existing Supabase-backed paths.
- Switched admin conversation/recommendation read panels to Neon so old Supabase chats are not surfaced after the conversation migration.
- Did not import, copy, backfill, or preserve old Supabase conversations or messages.

### 2026-05-22 - Usage, Manual Plan, And Admin Neon Route Slice

- Migrated billing-adjacent runtime data to fresh Neon repositories.
- Moved subscriptions, usage overrides, text usage events, image generation events, plan requests, admin audit logs, image history, dashboard data, admin data, pricing plan request flows, and profile/role hydration to Neon.
- Kept Supabase Auth sessions and Supabase Storage attachments in place.
- Preserved manual plan requests and admin activation; no payment automation was added.
- Did not import, copy, backfill, or preserve Supabase usage, subscription, or plan request rows.

### 2026-05-22 - Fresh Neon Credentials Auth

- Replaced Supabase Auth with custom Neon-backed ID/password credentials auth.
- Added local auth credentials and session tables.
- Stored password hashes with per-user salts and used opaque HTTP-only session cookies.
- Kept Supabase only for private attachment Storage.
- Did not import, copy, backfill, or preserve Supabase Auth users, sessions, or passwords; existing users need to sign up again.

### 2026-05-22 - Neutral Private File Storage

- Replaced active Supabase Storage upload/signing paths with a neutral server-only object storage abstraction.
- Added local development storage and S3-compatible/R2 production storage support.
- Added authenticated private file reads through `/api/files/object`.
- Stored new upload metadata in `zen_files` and generated-image metadata in `zen_generated_images`.
- Persisted newly generated Prism images into the same storage layer before saving conversation messages.
- Did not import, copy, backfill, or preserve old Supabase Storage objects.

### 2026-05-22 - Supabase Runtime Removal

- Removed remaining Supabase runtime clients and old Supabase-backed storage/data modules.
- Kept `supabase/migrations/*` as historical reference only and documented that they are not part of active setup.
- Kept Neon Postgres, Neon credentials auth, neutral private file storage, OpenRouter, and manual plan/admin activation as the active platform stack.
- Did not import, copy, backfill, or preserve old Supabase rows, users, sessions, passwords, or storage objects.

### 2026-05-22 - Pulse Tavily Web Search

- Added real server-side Tavily search for Pulse and the existing `webSearch` setting.
- Added source metadata to streamed and persisted assistant messages.
- Kept OpenRouter as the only AI model gateway and kept web search provider keys server-only.
- Search degrades without source claims when `TAVILY_API_KEY` is not configured.

### 2026-05-22 - Uploaded File Knowledge V1

- Added first-version project knowledge/RAG for uploaded text and code-like files.
- Added server-side text extraction, chunking, OpenAI-compatible embeddings, and Neon pgvector chunk storage.
- Wired `/api/chat` to retrieve scoped file chunks when `fileContext` is enabled and inject only relevant excerpts.
- Kept raw files private in object storage and left advanced PDF/OCR handling for later.

### 2026-05-22 - Reusable Prompt Workflows V1

- Added Neon-backed reusable prompt workflows as an extension of the existing prompt library.
- Added ordered workflow steps that target Nova, Velora, Axiom, Forge, Pulse, or Prism and support `{{variable}}` placeholders.
- Added workflow CRUD APIs and lightweight workflow run/step-run tracking.
- Wired the composer prompt popover with Prompts and Workflows tabs.
- Kept workflow execution simple: each step queues a normal chat or Prism image send, so existing chat/image routes, billing, memory, file context, and web search remain the execution path.
- Did not add payment automation, background jobs, or Supabase import/backfill logic.

### 2026-05-22 - Text Model Comparison V1

- Added a text-only comparison mode that sends one prompt to multiple available text assistants through OpenRouter.
- Added Neon tables, repository, and APIs for comparison records and generated candidates.
- Logged usage for every successful candidate and stored displayed usage/latency/model metadata for comparison.
- Added a composer comparison dialog with side-by-side candidate review and a "Save as best" action.
- Saving a candidate appends only the selected response to the conversation.
- Kept normal chat, Prism image generation, billing model, and manual plan upgrades unchanged.

### 2026-05-23 - Admin Cost And Margin Controls

- Added filter-aware admin analytics over Neon usage, image, subscription, override, profile, and plan request data.
- Added admin dashboard controls for date range, plan, assistant, and user filtering.
- Added admin-only visibility for raw model cost, displayed usage, estimated plan margin, text/image cost split, risky users near limits, high raw-cost users, expensive models, and assistant usage.
- Kept manual plan requests, admin activation, user dashboard displayed-cost behavior, and payment automation scope unchanged.

### 2026-05-24 - Verification Tooling Hardening

- Added an ESLint flat config for the current Next.js/TypeScript app.
- Added `npm run typecheck` as `tsc --noEmit`.
- Removed Next's TypeScript build-error ignore setting so `npm run build` runs TypeScript validation.
- Verified `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`, and `npm run lint` run successfully, with lint warnings still present as existing cleanup work.

### 2026-05-24 - Post-Neon Cutover Hardening

- Added Neon-backed sign-in attempt limiting and stronger local password/session handling.
- Tightened private object reads, attachment scope validation, and generated-image fetch safety.
- Added focused validation for manual plan requests, admin mutations, recommendation telemetry, and workflow run conversation scope.
- Made text/image usage counter updates atomic and dashboard displayed usage period-scoped.
- Kept Supabase runtime removed, avoided data imports/backfills, and kept manual plan requests/admin activation.

### 2026-05-24 - Pulse Web Search Verification

- Verified the current Pulse/webSearch path uses server-only Tavily retrieval, injects source context into `/api/chat`, streams source metadata, and persists sources on assistant messages.
- Added a total snippet budget to web search source normalization so retrieved snippets stay bounded before model injection.
- Expanded current/research prompt signals so Pulse is recommended for more source-backed, verification, and current-landscape prompts.
- Kept OpenRouter as the only model gateway and did not add Supabase or payment automation.

## Current Work

- Neon database foundation is complete at the code/schema level.
- Neon repositories exist as future route-by-route migration scaffolding and now cover the fresh schema, including user anchors, file metadata, and generated image metadata.
- Settings, prompt library, assistant recommendation telemetry, projects, conversations, messages, conversation memory, subscriptions/manual plans, usage overrides, text/image usage records, plan requests, dashboard data, image history, admin data, and profile/role hydration are now backed by fresh Neon repositories.
- Chat and image routes still use existing assistant execution paths, but their conversation, billing enforcement, and usage logging data now use Neon.
- Neutral private file storage is active for new uploads and generated images.
- Reusable prompt workflows are active in the composer prompt library popover.
- Text model comparison is active in the composer for text prompts.
- Admin cost and margin analytics are active on `/admin` and are backed by stored Neon usage data.
- Local verification now includes `npm run typecheck`, production build with TypeScript validation, and ESLint flat-config linting.

## Proposed Next Work

- Decide whether the repo should standardize on npm or pnpm.
- Clean up existing lint warnings when there is a dedicated cleanup milestone.
- Validate Tavily production limits and source display behavior for Pulse/webSearch.
- Validate embeddings provider cost/limits and pgvector query quality for uploaded-file knowledge.
- Apply and validate the fresh Neon foundation migration in a real Neon database.
- Plan remaining non-storage database route migrations, if any, as explicit bounded milestones.
- Validate S3-compatible/R2 configuration for production storage.
- Do not backfill existing Supabase Postgres data into Neon.
- Keep historical Supabase migrations as reference-only unless the team explicitly decides to remove or archive them elsewhere.

## Active Bugs / Issues

- `npm run lint` runs successfully but currently reports warnings.
- Package manager guidance is unclear because `pnpm-lock.yaml` exists while `README.md` says `npm install`.
- Generated image persistence should be reviewed.

## Architecture Concerns

- Text and image transports are intentionally separate and should remain separate.
- Neon is the source of truth for runtime app data and auth sessions; neutral object storage is the source for new private uploads and generated images.
- Neon Postgres is a fresh database foundation, not an imported copy of Supabase data.
- OpenRouter is the only AI model gateway.
- Tavily is the server-side web search provider for Pulse/webSearch source context.
- Uploaded-file knowledge uses server-only embeddings and Neon pgvector; raw files remain private.
- Prompt workflows run through the existing queued send path; they are not a durable background automation engine.
- Model comparison v1 is text-only; Prism/image comparison remains separate because image generation uses a different transport and wallet.
- Billing is currently manual/admin-driven, not payment-provider-driven.
- Server-only secrets must remain out of client components.

## Testing Status

- No dedicated test script is defined in `package.json`.
- Current scripts are `dev`, `build`, `start`, `lint`, and `typecheck`.
- `npm run typecheck` runs `tsc --noEmit`.
- `npm run lint` uses the root ESLint flat config.
- `npm run build` runs Next production build with TypeScript validation enabled.

## Known Risks

- Existing lint warnings remain and should be cleaned up in a focused follow-up.
- Package manager ambiguity.
- Pulse/webSearch requires `TAVILY_API_KEY` for live retrieval; without it the chat path continues without source claims.
- Uploaded-file knowledge requires an embeddings key and pgvector migration; unsupported files are skipped rather than blocking uploads.
- Payment automation is out of scope unless explicitly requested.
- Partial Neon migration can create split-system risk; future route migrations should be explicit and bounded.
- Supabase runtime clients and old Supabase-backed storage/data modules have been removed; only historical migrations remain.

## AI Handoff Summaries

### 2026-05-22

Shared memory files were created to give Codex, Claude Code, and future agents a consistent understanding of the repo. Future agents should begin by reading `AGENTS.md`, `AI_PROJECT.md`, `AI_TASK_LOG.md`, `AI_DECISIONS.md`, and `AI_CHECKLIST.md`.

## Future Feature Ideas

- Durable generated-image storage.
- Workflow templates, sharing, duplication, and richer run history.
- Automated test suite for auth, billing, routing, recommendations, and chat streaming.
- Safer incremental conversation persistence.
- Auth and storage strategy decision after the database migration plan is clear.

## Open Questions

- Should the package manager be standardized on pnpm or npm?
- Should local storage remain the default development adapter, or should all deployed environments require R2/S3?
- Should admin role management become database-only with no hardcoded fallback?
